## Use my project with the my contracts

In order for you to interact with the fronend you need to have metamask extension installed in your browser.
If you want to try the app the fast way, you can acces it here: https://b00ste.github.io/Unstoppable-Information/

## Fork my project

To fork and develop or use my project in any way you need to:
Firstly install node.js(https://nodejs.org/).
Secondly install Truffle in terminal: "npm install truffle -g".
After you can deploy your own contracts and change the addresses inside ./client/src/App.js.
If you choose to use my contract addresses you can go directly to ./client inside a terminal and use "npm start".

## Composition

Inside "client" folder is a react.js app which initially was created using "npx create-react-app"
and the was modified. Also inside this folder you can use "npm start" using terminal to open the site in localhost.

Outside "client" folder is the Truffle initialization using "truffle init" and then added my contracts and migration files.
